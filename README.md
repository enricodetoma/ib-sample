## Disclaimer

EVERYTHING in the TWSAPI section is not mine, it is all from the Interactive Brokers API samples (in the ~/IBJts/samples/Cpp/TestCppClient directory to be specific). I have included it for the purpose of reference and seeing the basic structure for developing a strategy on their platform, this is indicated in the README of the IBAPI section.
